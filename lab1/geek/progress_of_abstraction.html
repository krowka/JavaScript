    <h2>The progress of abstraction</h2>
    <p>
        All programming languages provide abstractions. It can be argued that the complexity of the problems you’re able
        to solve is directly related to the kind and quality of abstraction. By “kind” I mean, “What is it that you are
        abstracting?” Assembly language is a small abstraction of the underlying machine. Many so-called “imperative”
        languages that followed (such as FORTRAN, BASIC, and C) were abstractions of assembly language. These languages
        are big improvements over assembly language, but their primary abstraction still requires you to think in terms
        of the structure of the computer rather than the structure of the problem you are trying to solve. The
        programmer must establish the association between the machine model (in the “solution space,” which is the place
        where you’re implementing that solution, such as a computer) and the model of the problem that is actually being
        solved (in the Thinking in JavaBruce Eckel“problem space,” which is the place where the problem exists, such as
        a business). The effort required to perform this mapping, and the fact that it is extrinsic to the programming
        language, produces programs that are difficult to write and expensive to maintain, and as a side effect created
        the entire “programming methods” industry.
    </p>
    <p>
        The alternative to modeling the machine is to model the problem you’re trying to solve. Early languages such as
        LISP and APL chose particular views of the world (“All problems are ultimately lists” or “All problems are
        algorithmic,” respectively). Prolog casts all problems into chains of decisions. Languages have been created for
        constraint-based programming and for programming exclusively by manipulating graphical symbols. (The latter
        proved to be too restrictive.) Each of these approaches may be a good solution to the particular class of
        problem they’re designed to solve, but when you step outside of that domain they become awkward.
    </p>
    <p>
        The object-oriented approach goes a step further by providing tools for the programmer to represent elements in
        the problem space. This representation is general enough that the programmer is not constrained to any
        particular type of problem. We refer to the elements in the problem space and their representations in the
        solution space as “objects.” (You will also need other objects that don’t have problem-space analogs.) The idea
        is that the program is allowed to adapt itself to the lingo of the problem by adding new types of objects, so
        when you read the code describing the solution, you’re reading words that also express the problem. This is a
        more flexible and powerful language abstraction than what we’ve had before.

        Thus, OOP allows you to describe
        the problem in terms of the problem, rather than in terms of the computer where the solution will run. There’s
        still a connection back to the computer: Each object looks quite a bit like a little computer—it has a state,
        and it has operations that you can ask it to perform. However, this doesn’t seem like such a bad analogy to
        objects in the real world—they all have characteristics and behaviors.
    </p>
    <p>
        Alan Kay summarized five basic characteristics of Smalltalk, the first successful object-oriented language and
        one of the languages upon which Java is based. These characteristics represent a pure approach to
        object-oriented programming:

    <dl>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <dt>Everything is an object.</dt>
            </li>
            <dd>
                Think of an object as a fancy variable; it stores data, but you can “make
                requests” to that object, asking it to perform operations on itself. In theory, you can take any
                conceptual component in the problem you’re trying to solve (dogs, buildings, services, etc.) and
                represent it as an object in your program.
            </dd>

            <li>
                <dt>A program is a bunch of objects telling each other what to do by sending messages.</dt>
            </li>
            <dd>
                To make a request of
                an object, you “send a message” to that object. More concretely, you can think of a message as a request
                to call a method that belongs to a particular object.
            </dd>

            <li>
                <dt>Each object has its own memory made up of other objects.</dt>
            </li>
            <dd>
                Put another way, you create a new kind of
                object by making a package containing existing objects. Thus, you can build complexity into a program
                while hiding it behind the simplicity of objects.
            </dd>

            <li>
                <dt>Every object has a type.</dt>
            </li>
            <dd>
                Using the parlance, each object is an instance of a class, in which “class” is
                synonymous with “type.” The most important distinguishing characteristic of a class is “What messages
                can you send to it?”
            </dd>

            <li>
                <dt>All objects of a particular type can receive the same messages.</dt>
            </li>
            <dd>
                This is actually a loaded statement, as
                you will see later. Because an object of type “circle” is also an object of type “shape,” a circle is
                guaranteed to accept shape messages. This means you can write code that talks to shapes and
                automatically handle anything that fits the description of a shape. This substitutability is one of the
                powerful concepts in OOP.
            </dd>
        </ol>
    </dl>
    </p>

    <p>Booch offers an even more succinct description of an object:</p>
    <div style="margin-left: 50px">
        <p><em>An object has state, behavior and identity.</em></p>
    </div>
    <p>
        This means that an object can have internal data (which gives it state), methods (to produce behavior),
        and each object can be uniquely distinguished from every other object—to put this in a concrete sense,
        each object has a unique address in memory.
