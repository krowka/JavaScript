    <h2>The hidden implementation</h2>
    <p>
        It is helpful to break up the playing field into class creators (those who create new data types) and client
        programmers
        <sup id="ref4"><a class="sb" href="#fn4" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top"
                          title="I’m indebted to my friend Scott Meyers for this term.">
            4</a></sup>
        (the class consumers who use the data types in their applications). The goal of the client
        programmer is to collect a toolbox full of classes to use for rapid application development. The goal of the
        class creator is to build a class that exposes only what’s necessary to the client programmer and keeps
        everything else hidden. Why? Because if it’s hidden, the client programmer can’t access it, which means that the
        class creator can change the hidden portion at will without worrying about the impact on anyone else. The hidden
        portion usually represents the tender insides of an object that could easily be corrupted by a careless or
        uninformed client programmer, so hiding the implementation reduces program bugs.
    </p>

    <p>
        In any relationship it’s important to have boundaries that are respected by all parties involved. When you
        create a library, you establish a relationship with the client programmer, who is also a programmer, but one who
        is putting together an application by using your library, possibly to build a bigger library. If all the members
        of a class are available to everyone, then the client programmer can do anything with that class and there’s no
        way to enforce rules. Even though you might really prefer that the client programmer not directly manipulate
        some of the members of your class, without access control there’s no way to prevent it. Everything’s naked to
        the world.
    </p>

    <p>
        So the first reason for access control is to keep client programmers’ hands off portions they shouldn’t
        touch—parts that are necessary for the internal operation of the data type but not part of the interface that
        users need in order to solve their particular problems. This is actually a service to client programmers because
        they can easily see what’s important to them and what they can ignore.
    </p>

    <p>
        The second reason for access control is to allow the library designer to change the internal workings of the
        class without worrying about how it will affect the client programmer. For example, you might implement a
        particular class in a simple fashion to ease development, and then later discover that you need to rewrite it in
        order to make it run faster. If the interface and implementation are clearly separated and protected, you can
        accomplish this easily.
    </p>

    <p>
        Java uses three explicit keywords to set the boundaries in a class: <b>public</b>, <b>private</b>, and
        <b>protected</b>. These access specifiers determine who can use the definitions that follow. <b>public</b>
        means the following element is available to everyone. The <b>private</b> keyword, on the other hand, means
        that no one can access that element except you, the creator of the type, inside methods of that type.
        <b>private</b> is a brick wall between you and the client programmer. Someone who tries to access a
        <b>private</b> member will get a compile-time error. The <b>protected</b> keyword acts like
        <b>private</b>, with the exception that an inheriting class has access to <b>protected</b> members,
        but not private members. Inheritance will be introduced shortly.
    </p>

    <p>
        Java also has a “default” access, which comes into play if you don’t use one of the aforementioned specifiers.
        This is usually called package access because classes can access the members of other classes in the same
        package (library component), but outside of the package those same members appear to be <b>private</b>.
