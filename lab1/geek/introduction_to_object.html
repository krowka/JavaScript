            We cut nature up, organize it into concepts, and ascribe significances as we do, largely because we are
            parties to an agreement that holds throughout our speech community and is codified in the patterns of our
            language ... we cannot talk at all except by subscribing to the organization and classification of data
            which the agreement decrees.
        </p>

    <p>
        The genesis of the computer revolution was in a machine. The genesis of our programming languages
        thus tends to look like that machine.
    </p>
    <p>
        But computers are not so much machines as they are mind amplification tools (“bicycles for the
        mind,” as Steve Jobs is fond of saying) and a different kind of expressive medium. As a result, the tools are
        beginning to look less like machines and more like parts of our minds, and also like other forms of expression
        such as writing, painting, sculpture, animation, and filmmaking. Object-oriented programming (OOP)
        is part of this movement toward using the computer as an expressive medium.
    </p>
    <p>
        This chapter will introduce you to the basic concepts of OOP, including an overview of development methods.
        This chapter, and this book, assumes that you have some
        programming experience, although not necessarily in C. If you think you need more preparation in programming
        before
        tackling this book, you should work through the Thinking in C multimedia seminar, downloadable from
        www.MindView.net.
    </p>
    <p>This chapter is background and supplementary material. Many people do not feel comfortable wading
        into object-oriented programming without understanding the big picture first. Thus, there are many concepts that
        are
        introduced here to give you a solid overview of OOP. However, other people may not get the big picture concepts
        until they’ve seen some of the mechanics first; these people may become bogged down and lost without some code
        to
        get their hands on. If you’re part of this latter group and are eager to get to the specifics of the language,
        feel
        free to jump past this chapter—skipping it at this point will not prevent you from writing programs or learning
        the
        language. However, you will want to come back here eventually to fill in your knowledge so you can understand
        why
        objects are important and how to design with them.
