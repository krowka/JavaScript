    <h2>An object provides services</h2>

    <p>
        While you’re trying to develop or understand a program design, one of the best ways to think about objects is as
        “service providers.” Your program itself will provide services to the user, and it will accomplish this by using
        the services offered by other objects. Your goal is to Introduction to Objects produce (or even better, locate
        in existing code libraries) a set of objects that provide the ideal services to solve your problem.
    </p>

    <p>
        A way to start doing this is to ask, “If I could magically pull them out of a hat, what objects would solve my
        problem right away?” For example, suppose you are creating a bookkeeping program. You might imagine some objects
        that contain pre-defined bookkeeping input screens, another set of objects that perform bookkeeping
        calculations, and an object that handles printing of checks and invoices on all different kinds of printers.
        Maybe some of these objects already exist, and for the ones that don’t, what would they look like? What services
        would those objects provide, and what objects would they need to fulfill their obligations? If you keep doing
        this, you will eventually reach a point where you can say either, “That object seems simple enough to sit down
        and write” or “I’m sure that object must exist already.” This is a reasonable way to decompose a problem into a
        set of objects.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thinking of an object as a service provider has an additional benefit: It helps to improve the cohesiveness of
        the object. High cohesion is a fundamental quality of software design: It means that the various aspects of a
        software component (such as an object, although this could also apply to a method or a library of objects) “fit
        together” well. One problem people have when designing objects is cramming too much functionality into one
        object. For example, in your check printing module, you may decide you need an object that knows all about
        formatting and printing. You’ll probably discover that this is too much for one object, and that what you need
        is three or more objects. One object might be a catalog of all the possible check layouts, which can be queried
        for information about how to print a check. One object or set of objects can be a generic printing interface
        that knows all about different kinds of printers (but nothing about bookkeeping—this one is a candidate for
        buying rather than writing yourself). And a third object could use the services of the other two to accomplish
        the task. Thus, each object has a cohesive set of services it offers. In a good object-oriented design, each
        object does one thing well, but doesn’t try to do too much. This not only allows the discovery of objects that
        might be purchased (the printer interface object), but it also produces new objects that might be reused
        somewhere else (the catalog of check layouts).
    </p>

    <p>
        Treating objects as service providers is a great simplifying tool. This is useful not only during the design
        process, but also when someone else is trying to understand your code or reuse an object. If they can see the
        value of the object based on what service it provides, it makes it much easier to fit it into the design.
