    <h2>What is Java?</h2>

    <p>Java is a general-purpose computer-programming language that is concurrent, class-based,
        object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is
        intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java
        code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications
        are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer
        architecture. As of 2016, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use,
        particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers. Java was
        originally developed by James Gosling, a Canadian, at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by
        Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The
        language derives much of its original features from SmallTalk, with a syntax similar to C and C++, but it
        has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.</p>

    <p>The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were
        originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications
        of the Java Community Process, Sun relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public
        License. Others have also developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies, such as the GNU
        Compiler for Java (bytecode compiler), GNU Classpath (standard libraries), and IcedTea-Web (browser plugin
        for applets).</p>

    <p>The latest version is Java 11, released on September 25, 2018. Java 11 is a currently supported long-term
        support (LTS) version ("Oracle Customers will receive Oracle Premier Support"); Oracle released for the
        "legacy" Java 8 LTS the last "public update", which is free for commercial use, in January 2019. Oracle will
        still support Java 8 with public updates for personal use up to at least December 2020. Oracle (and others)
        "highly recommend that you uninstall older versions of Java", because of serious risks due to unresolved
        security issues. Since Java 9 is no longer supported, Oracle advises its users to "immediately
        transition" to Java 11. Oracle extended support for Java 6 ended in December 2018</p>

    <h2> Java history </h2>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gosling">James Gosling</a>, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991.
        Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable
        television industry at the time. The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood
        outside Gosling's office. Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java
        coffee. Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style syntax that system and application programmers would find
        familiar.</p>

    <p>Sun Microsystems released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1996. It promised
        <em><strong><abbr title="Write Once, Run Anywhere">WORA</abbr></strong></em>, providing no-cost run-times on
        popular platforms. Fairly secure and featuring configurable security, it allowed network- and file-access
        restrictions. Major web browsers soon incorporated the ability to run Java applets within web pages, and
        Java quickly became popular. The Java 1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur van Hoff to comply
        strictly with the Java 1.0 language specification. With the advent of Java 2 (released initially as J2SE 1.2
        in December 1998 – 1999), new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of platforms.
        J2EE included technologies and APIs for enterprise applications typically run in server environments,
        while J2ME featured APIs optimized for mobile applications. The desktop version was renamed J2SE.
        In 2006, for marketing purposes, Sun renamed new J2 versions as Java EE, Java ME, and Java SE,
        respectively.</p>

    <p>In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO/IEC JTC 1 standards body and later the Ecma International to
        formalize Java, but it soon withdrew from the process. Java remains a de facto standard,
        controlled through the Java Community Process. At one time, Sun made most of its Java implementations
        available without charge, despite their proprietary software status. Sun generated revenue from Java through
        the selling of licenses for specialized products such as the Java Enterprise System.</p>

    <p>On November 13, 2006, Sun released much of its Java virtual machine (JVM) as free and open-source software,
        (FOSS), under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL). On May 8, 2007, Sun finished the process,
        making all of its JVM's core code available under free software/open-source distribution terms, aside from a
        small portion of code to which Sun did not hold the copyright.</p>

    <p>Sun's vice-president Rich Green said that Sun's ideal role with regard to Java was as an "evangelist".
        Following Oracle Corporation's acquisition of Sun Micro-systems in 2009–10, Oracle has described itself as
        the "steward of Java technology with a relentless commitment to fostering a community of participation and
        transparency". This did not prevent Oracle from filing a lawsuit against Google shortly after that for
        using Java inside the Android SDK (see Google section below). Java software runs on everything from laptops
        to data centers, game consoles to scientific supercomputers. On April 2, 2010, James Gosling resigned
        from Oracle.</p>

    <p>In January 2016, Oracle announced that Java run-time environments based on JDK 9 will discontinue the
        browser plugin</p>
